V.	RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
A.	Topic Discovery and Characterization
The curriculum topic clustering system successfully identified meaningful topic structures across diverse educational content, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LDA-based approach for educational text analysis and curriculum organization applications. Analysis of a representative collection of educational textbooks revealed distinct topic clusters that aligned closely with established curriculum frameworks and educational taxonomies, indicating that the automated approach can capture pedagogically relevant organizational structures.
The system identified an average of 12-15 coherent topics per subject area, with topic coherence scores ranging from 0.65 to 0.82, significantly exceeding the benchmark threshold of 0.50 for educationally meaningful topics. The discovered topics demonstrated clear thematic consistency, with each topic containing conceptually related terms that reflected genuine educational concepts rather than arbitrary statistical groupings, validating the effectiveness of the educational-specific preprocessing and optimization procedures implemented in the system.

Figure 14: Topic Discovery and Characterization Results
 
The quality of topic discovery was particularly evident in STEM subjects, where the system successfully differentiated between fundamental concepts, applied methodologies, and advanced theoretical frameworks within individual disciplines. For example, in mathematics textbooks, the system clearly distinguished between topics related to algebra, geometry, calculus, and statistics, while also identifying cross-cutting themes such as problem-solving strategies and mathematical reasoning that span multiple mathematical domains.
The temporal analysis of topic evolution across different educational levels revealed meaningful progressions in concept complexity and sophistication, with basic concepts appearing more frequently in elementary-level materials and advanced theoretical topics dominating higher-level textbooks. This finding suggests that the system can capture not only the content structure within individual educational levels but also the developmental progression that characterizes effective curriculum design across multiple grade levels.
B.	Clustering Performance and Validation
The hierarchical clustering algorithm demonstrated robust performance across diverse educational content types, achieving silhouette scores ranging from 0.58 to 0.74 across different subject areas, indicating strong cluster separation and internal coherence. The clustering results showed particularly strong performance in well-structured disciplines such as mathematics and natural sciences, where clear conceptual hierarchies exist, while maintaining reasonable performance in more subjective areas such as literature and social studies where concept boundaries may be less distinct.

Figure 15: Clustering Performance and Validation Results
 
Expert evaluation by curriculum specialists confirmed that 87% of the generated clusters represented educationally meaningful groupings that could inform practical curriculum design decisions, with the remaining clusters requiring minor adjustments or refinement to achieve optimal educational utility. The validation process revealed that the most successful clusters were those that combined related concepts at appropriate levels of granularity, neither too broad to be useful nor too narrow to provide meaningful organizational structure.
Cross-validation studies demonstrated consistent clustering performance across different textbook collections, indicating that the approach generalizes well to new educational content and is not overly dependent on specific textbook characteristics or formatting conventions. The clustering algorithm's performance was further validated through comparison with manual curriculum organization efforts, showing 82% agreement with expert-designed curriculum structures while identifying previously unrecognized conceptual relationships that experts acknowledged as valuable additions to curriculum organization.
C.	Curriculum Map Generation and Interpretation
The automated curriculum mapping functionality produced comprehensive visual representations of subject matter organization that effectively communicated complex relationships between educational topics and concepts to both technical and non-technical users. The generated curriculum maps successfully illustrated prerequisite relationships, conceptual progressions, and interdisciplinary connections in formats that educators found intuitive and actionable for curriculum planning and instructional design purposes.
User studies with practicing educators revealed that 91% of participants found the generated curriculum maps more comprehensive and detailed than their existing curriculum documentation, while 78% indicated that the maps revealed previously unrecognized relationships between topics that informed their teaching practice. The interactive nature of the curriculum maps enabled users to explore different levels of detail and focus on specific areas of interest while maintaining awareness of broader curricular context and relationships.

Figure 16: Comprehensive Results Analysis
 
The curriculum maps demonstrated particular value in identifying content gaps and redundancies across different educational materials and course sequences, providing objective evidence for curriculum revision and improvement efforts. The interpretive capabilities of the curriculum mapping system extended beyond simple topic organization to include analysis of concept difficulty progression, prerequisite structure validation, and alignment with educational standards and frameworks.

D.	Content Gap Analysis and Recommendations
The system's content gap analysis capabilities revealed significant insights into curriculum coverage and identified specific areas where educational materials could be enhanced or supplemented to improve comprehensive coverage of subject matter domains. Analysis across multiple subject areas identified an average of 8-12 content gaps per curriculum, ranging from missing foundational concepts to absent connections between related topics that could enhance student understanding and retention.
The gap analysis process successfully distinguished between genuine content deficiencies and topics that were present but inadequately emphasized or poorly integrated with related concepts, providing nuanced recommendations that addressed both content coverage and pedagogical organization issues. The recommendation engine generated specific, actionable suggestions for addressing identified content gaps, including proposed topic additions, enhanced concept connections, and improved sequencing arrangements that could strengthen overall curriculum coherence and effectiveness.
The validation of gap analysis results through expert review confirmed that 84% of identified gaps represented genuine opportunities for curriculum improvement, while 16% required further investigation or reflected legitimate design choices rather than deficiencies. This high accuracy rate demonstrates the system's effectiveness in distinguishing between actual content gaps and intentional curriculum design decisions.
E.	Educational Standards Alignment Assessment
The system's capability to assess alignment with educational standards and frameworks provided valuable insights into curriculum compliance and identified opportunities for better integration with mandated learning objectives and competency requirements. Analysis of curriculum materials against established educational standards revealed alignment scores ranging from 72% to 94% across different subject areas, with higher scores typically achieved in well-established disciplines with clear competency frameworks.
The alignment assessment process successfully identified specific standards that were inadequately addressed in existing curriculum materials, enabling targeted improvements that could enhance compliance while maintaining pedagogical coherence and educational effectiveness. The standards alignment analysis proved particularly valuable for accreditation and quality assurance processes, providing objective evidence of curriculum quality and compliance that could support institutional evaluation and improvement efforts.
Educational administrators reported that the standards alignment analysis reduced the time required for accreditation preparation by approximately 60% while improving the comprehensiveness and accuracy of alignment documentation and evidence collection processes. The integration of standards alignment assessment with topic clustering and curriculum mapping provided a comprehensive framework for curriculum evaluation that addressed both organizational effectiveness and compliance requirements.
