# MASTERS RESEARCH: NLP-Based Curriculum Topic Clustering System

**Research Title:** Automated Curriculum Topic Clustering from Educational Textbooks using Advanced Natural Language Processing Techniques

**Author:** Dennis Ngugi  
**Research Level:** Masters Thesis  
**Institution:** Advanced Educational Technology Research

## Research Abstract Implementation

This system addresses the exponential growth of educational content and the increasing complexity of modern curricula by developing automated tools for content organization and curriculum design. The research presents a comprehensive analysis of developing an NLP-based system for curriculum topic clustering from educational textbooks, focusing on the application of **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and **hierarchical clustering techniques**.

The proposed system processes large collections of textbook content, automatically generates curriculum maps, and provides educators with tools for designing coherent lesson plans while detecting content overlaps. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, this system addresses the critical need for intelligent curriculum organization in educational institutions.

```

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download NLTK data (run once):
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```

## Usage

### 1. Web Scraping (Jupyter Notebook)

Open and run `KEC_Education_ML_Analysis.ipynb`:

```bash
jupyter notebook KEC_Education_ML_Analysis.ipynb
```

The notebook will:
- Connect to https://kec.ac.ke/
- Scrape Form 1-4 educational content
- Save data for analysis

### 2. Machine Learning Analysis

Run the classification system:

```bash
python ml_classification.py
```

This will:
- Process and classify scraped content
- Train ML models for subject classification
- Generate visualizations
- Create a question-answering system

### 3. Key Classes and Functions

#### `KECWebScraper`
- `scrape_main_page()`: Scrapes main KEC page for education links
- `scrape_content_page()`: Extracts content from individual pages
- `scrape_all_content()`: Main scraping method

#### `EducationContentClassifier`
- `preprocess_text()`: Cleans and processes text data
- `classify_by_keywords()`: Subject classification using keywords
- `train_classifier()`: Trains ML models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- `predict_content()`: Predicts subject for new content

#### `QuestionAnsweringSystem`
- `find_relevant_content()`: Finds content relevant to questions
- `answer_question()`: Generates answers based on scraped content

### 4. Research Question Analysis

The system can answer questions like:
- "What mathematical concepts are taught in Form 2?"
- "How is biology curriculum structured across forms?"
- "What are the key physics topics in secondary education?"

Example usage:
```python
# Load your scraped data
df = pd.read_csv('scraped_content.csv')

# Initialize systems
classifier = EducationContentClassifier()
qa_system = QuestionAnsweringSystem(df)

# Ask questions
answer = qa_system.answer_question("What is algebra in Form 1?")
print(answer)
```

## Machine Learning Models

The system uses multiple ML algorithms:
- **Random Forest**: For robust classification
- **Logistic Regression**: For interpretable results
- **SVM**: For high-dimensional text data
- **Gradient Boosting**: For improved accuracy

Features extracted:
- TF-IDF vectors from text content
- Subject keywords matching
- Grade/Form level detection
- Content length and complexity metrics

## Visualizations

The system generates:
- Subject distribution pie charts
- Grade level distribution bar charts
- Content length histograms
- Word clouds of common terms
- Topic modeling results

## Output Files

- `education_analysis.png`: Visualization charts
- `education_classifier.pkl`: Trained ML model
- `scraped_content.csv`: Raw scraped data (generated during scraping)

## Ethical Considerations

- Respects robots.txt and implements delays between requests
- Uses appropriate User-Agent headers
- Scrapes only publicly available educational content
- Intended for educational research purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Selenium WebDriver Issues**:
   - Ensure Chrome browser is installed
   - WebDriver will auto-download via webdriver-manager

2. **Network/Access Issues**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify KEC website accessibility
   - Some content may require authentication

3. **Memory Issues with Large Datasets**:
   - Process data in chunks
   - Reduce max_features in TfidfVectorizer
   - Use sparse matrices for large text corpora

4. **NLTK Data Missing**:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('all')  # Downloads all NLTK data
   ```

## Research Applications

This system can help with:
- Curriculum analysis and comparison
- Educational content gap identification
- Learning objective mapping
- Assessment question generation
- Content difficulty analysis
- Subject integration opportunities

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with more educational websites
- Advanced NLP models (BERT, GPT)
- Real-time content monitoring
- Multi-language support
- Interactive web interface
- Database integration for large-scale analysis
